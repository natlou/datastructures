Normalize the rotations, so they do not exceed the length of the array. For example, for an array of length 10
10
, rotating by 14
14
 elements is the same as rotating by (14%10) 4 elements.

Convert negative rotations to positive rotations.

Reverse the elements of the original array.

Reverse the elements from 0
0
 to n-1
n−1
.

Reverse the elements from n
n
 to length-1
length−1
.
