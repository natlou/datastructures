Ways to Represent a Graph#
The two most common ways to represent a graph are:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List
Adjacency Matrix#
The adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional matrix where each cell can contain a 0 or a 1.â€‹ The row and column headings represent the vertices.

If a cell contains 1, there exists an edge between the corresponding vertices e.g., Matrix[0][1]=1
Matrix[0][1]=1
 shows that an edge exists between vertex 0 and 1.


In the image above, there is a directed graph that has an edge going from vertex 0 to vertex 1, so there is a 1 at Matrix[0][1]
Matrix[0][1]
 in the adjacency matrix. In the case of the undirected graph, we would have Matrix[1][0] = 1
Matrix[1][0]=1
 as well since the edge is bidirectional.

For a directed graph, the usual convention is to think of the rows as sources and the columns as destinations.


Adjacency List#
An array of linked list is used to store all the edges in the graph. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices.

Each index in this array represents a specific vertex in the graph. The entry at index i of the array contains a linked list containing the vertices that are adjacent to vertex i.
