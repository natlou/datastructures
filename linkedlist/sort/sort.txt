It only takes a few steps to implement insertion sort. To do so, we’ll maintain two linked lists:

Original list (given to us as input)
Sorted list (initially empty)
Here is how the algorithm works:

While the original list is not empty:
   Remove an element (say 'X') from the original list.
   Insert 'X' at the correct sorted position in the sorted list.
To insert a node in the sorted linked list, we may need to scan the whole sorted list depending upon the inserted node.

Let’s take an example where the input linked list is 29 -> 23 -> 82 -> 11.
