Solution#
For this solution, we do a post-order (left, right, parent) traversal of the binary tree. The algorithm is as follows:

    Start at the root node.
    Perform a post-order traversal of the binary tree.
    On every node during the traversal, we swap its left child with its right child.
    Since we perform a depth-first search traversal, the children of any node are already mirrored even before we return the node itself.
