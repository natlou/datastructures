Solution 1#
We need two queues to solve this problem:

The current queue
The next queue
We will conform to the following steps for this solution:

First, we declare an array of two queues. This step will help us, later on, to swap values between our two queues.

We then declare and point the current queue to the 0^{th}
 
 index queue of the array and the next queue to the 1^{st}
 
 index queue.

We then push the root node into the current queue and set the level to zero.

Now, we carry out the following operations until the current queue is empty:

Dequeue the first element of the queue and print its data.
Enqueue the nodeâ€™s children we dequeued in the previous step into the next queue.
If the current queue is empty, increase the level number and print a new line. Then assign the current queue to the next queue, and the next queue to the current queue.
If the current queue is still empty, we terminate the loop.
